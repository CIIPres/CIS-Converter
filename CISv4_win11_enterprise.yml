Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems. Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk. Enabled: Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for Windows. Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable driver (recommended). Note: Do not, under any circumstances, configure this overall setting as Disabled, as doing so will delete the underlying registry entry altogether, which will cause serious problems."
  rationale: "Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.

  description: "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects cause the IPv4 stack to plumb host routes. These routes override the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) generated routes. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
  rationale: "This behavior is expected. The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the ICMP redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic will no longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will limit the system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the network."
  impact: "When Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is configured as an autonomous system boundary router (ASBR), it does not correctly import connected interface subnet routes. Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF routes. However, the OSPF router cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet routes are imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing paths."

- id: 26014
  title: "Ensure 'MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers' is set to 'Enabled'"
  description: "NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
  rationale: "The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries. An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the production environment. The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons, the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution."

- id: 26049
  title: "Ensure 'Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes: Prevent installation of devices using drivers for these device setup' is set to 'IEEE 1394 device setup classes'"
  description: "This policy setting allows you to specify a list of device setup class globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for device drivers that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device. If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing or updating device drivers whose device setup class GUIDs appear in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings. Here are the four entries we recommend and what they translate to: • {d48179be-ec20-11d1-b6b8-00c04fa372a7} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the SBP2 Protocol Class • {7ebefbc0-3200-11d2-b4c2-00a0C9697d07} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the IEC-61883 Protocol Class • {c06ff265-ae09-48f0-812c-16753d7cba83} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the AVC Protocol Class • {6bdd1fc1-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f} - IEEE 1394 Host Bus Controller Class The full list of system-defined device setup classes available in Windows is here: System-Defined Device Setup Classes Available to Vendors | Microsoft Docs The recommended state for this setting is: {d48179be-ec20-11d1-b6b8- 00c04fa372a7}, {7ebefbc0-3200-11d2-b4c2-00a0C9697d07}, {c06ff265-ae09- 48f0-812c-16753d7cba83}, and {6bdd1fc1-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f} Note: IEEE 1394 has also been known/branded as FireWire (by Apple), i.LINK (by Sony) and Lynx (by Texas Instruments)."
  rationale: "A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked. BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks. This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445: Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker."
  impact: "IEEE 1394 drives & devices will be prevented from being installed in Windows."

  description: "This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The \"Allow data recovery agent\" check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.

In \"Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information\" select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key. Select \"Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard\" to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting. In \"Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services\" choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives.

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs. If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the \"Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM\" check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive. On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both. Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

  title: "Ensure 'Join Microsoft MAPS' is set to 'Disabled'"
  description: "This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft renamed to Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service and then Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer. Possible options are: • (0x0) Disabled (default) • (0x1) Basic membership • (0x2) Advanced membership Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful. Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: In Windows 10 and above, Basic membership is no longer available, so setting the value to 1 Basic, or 2 Advanced, enrolls the device into Advanced membership. For more information, please visit: Turn on cloud protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Microsoft Learn."
  rationale: "The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or contact you. For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data submissions altogether."

  description: "This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific security layer to secure communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: SSL. Note: In spite of this setting being labeled SSL, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer Security (TLS), not the older and less secure, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol."
  rationale: "The native RDP encryption is now considered a weak protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger TLS encryption for all RDP communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred."
  impact: "TLS will be required to authenticate to the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not supported, the connection fails. Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the Server authentication certificate template setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work. Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session."

 # 6.20 (L1) Ensure 'Object Access Audit Removable Storage' is set to 'Success and Failure'
- id: 26191
  title: "Ensure 'Object Access Audit Removable Storage' is set to 'Success and Failure'"
  description: "This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all types of access requested. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure. Note: A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy."
  rationale: "Auditing removable storage may be useful when investigating an incident. For example, if an individual is suspected of copying sensitive information onto a USB drive."
  impact: "If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected, or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities."

If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. • 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. • 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. • 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. • 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. • 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. • 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. • 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem. • 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started. • 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. • 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces.

  title: "Ensure 'Enable Virtualization Based Security' is set to 'Enable virtualization based security'"
  description: "This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled. Virtualization Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services. The recommended state for this setting is: Enable virtualization based security. Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM. More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs."
  rationale: "Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system."
  impact: "Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1) profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues.

  description: "This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0. Note: Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 730 days. If this policy is set to the value 0, the password will never expire."
  rationale: "The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current."
  impact: "If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them.

  description: "This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. In an Intune managed environment this setting applies to local user accounts and not Entra ID accounts. The value includes the user's current password. This value denotes that with a setting of 1, the user can't reuse their current password when choosing a new password, while a setting of 5 means that a user can't set their new password to their current password or any of their previous four passwords. The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s)."
  rationale: "The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password."
  impact: "The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess.

Note: When a user reaches the value set by this policy, the system is not wiped, instead the system will be in BitLocker recovery mode, which makes data inaccessible but recoverable. If BitLocker is not enabled, then this policy will not be enforced."
  rationale: "Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password brute force attack will be successful. Setting the account lockout threshold too low introduces risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally locking out accounts."
  impact: "If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting may generate additional help desk calls. If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition by deliberately generating failed logons for multiple users, therefore you should also configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value.

  description: "This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a local user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s)."
  rationale: "Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords."
  impact: "Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Warning: Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts: The out-of-box experience (OOBE) or user desktop auto logon can fail when a device reboots during the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). This failure can occur when certain DeviceLock policies are applied to a device. If Windows Autopilot is used in the environment, assign this setting exclusively to user groups rather than device groups. This ensures the setting is applied later during enrollment, allowing Windows Autopilot to complete its pre-provisioning process and prevent potential interruptions.

  rationale: "Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective."

  rationale: "The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination. The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on."

  rationale: "It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver.

  description: "This policy setting specifies the text displayed in the title bar of the window that users see when they log on to the system. Configure this setting in a manner that is consistent with the security and operational requirements of your organization."
  rationale: "Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happens. It may also help to reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the logon process."
  impact: "Users will have to acknowledge a dialog box with the configured title before they can log on to the computer. Warning: Windows Autopilot - Policy Conflicts: Windows Autopilot pre-provisioning doesn't work when this policy setting is configured. If Windows Autopilot is used in the environment, assign this setting exclusively to user groups rather than device groups. This ensures the setting is applied later during enrollment, allowing Windows Autopilot to complete its pre-provisioning process and prevent potential interruptions."

 # 49.11 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior' is set to 'Lock Workstation' or higher
- id: 26292
  title: "Ensure 'Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior' is set to 'Lock Workstation' or higher"
  description: "This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to the benchmark."
  rationale: "Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials."
  impact: "If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session. If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is removed. If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader- equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function identically to Lock Workstation. Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email."

  title: "Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled'"
  description: "This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component. Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings, see the \"Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related settings)\" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
  rationale: "Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."
  impact: "The Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1 when certain SMB signing policies are enabled."

- id: 26303
  title: "Ensure 'Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests' is set to 'Block'"
  description: "This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer. The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain. With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U. When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes. The recommended state for this setting is: Block."
  rationale: "The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be managed centrally in most managed networks."
  impact: "Remote Desktop connections from a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined server to a Microsoft Entra joined Windows 10 device or a Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows 10 device will fail if PKU2U is disabled."

  description: "This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash.

 # 49.24 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send LM and NTLMv2 responses only. Refuse LM and NTLM'
- id: 26305
  title: "Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send LM and NTLMv2 responses only. Refuse LM and NTLM'"
  description: "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: • Join a domain • Authenticate between Active Directory forests • Authenticate to down-level domains • Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP • Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. The recommended state for this setting is: Send LM and NTLMv2 responses only. Refuse LM and NTLM."
  rationale: "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible."
  impact: "Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM."

As a result, prompts may appear when modifying user account control (UAC) settings during the Out of the Box Experience (OOBE) using the device Enrollment Status Page (ESP). Increased prompts are more likely if the device reboots after policies are applied.

  rationale: "This is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their network shares in the environment (i.e. \"Network Neighborhood\").

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: Although CIS categorizes this as a L2 recommendation, if none of the cases listed in the Impact Section apply, we highly recommend disabling this service."
  rationale: "This service is primarily needed to support Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD), which is an auto-proxy discovery mechanism that could expose the computer to Man-In-The- Middle (MITM) attacks. If an organization depends on HTTP proxy configuration, it is recommended that other client configuration mechanisms be used instead, such as Group Policy."
  impact: "WPAD will cease to function for automatic HTTP proxy routing, which may prevent Internet connectivity for workstations in organizations that currently use WPAD. Microsoft also cautions that some software that uses the network stack may have a functional dependency on this service, so it is advised that you test disabling this service on a representation of user workstations and applications before disabling it across the entire organization. Beginning with Windows 10 Release 1709, Microsoft changed the WPAD service to tightly integrate it with all proxy activity. Disabling this service now has these additional impacts: • The ability to set a manual (not just auto) proxy configuration. • Some VPN clients require the WPAD service, so disabling WPAD breaks them. • Some network-related applications will not work without WPAD running (e.g. Fiddler)."

 # 89.2 (L1) Ensure 'Access From Network' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users'
- id: 26394
  title: "Ensure 'Access From Network' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users'"
  description: "This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object Model Plus (COM+). The recommended state for this setting is: *S-1-5-32-544 and *S-1-5-32-555 (Administrators, Remote Desktop Users). Note: If your organization is using Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)), the (organization-named) Defender for Identity Directory Service Account (DSA), will also need to be granted the same Access from network User Right Assignment. For more information on adding the service account please see Make sure the DSA is allowed to access computers from the network in Microsoft Defender for Identity | Microsoft Docs."
  rationale: "Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on target computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this computer from the network user right is required for users to connect to shared printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will be able to read the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for new installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for computers that you upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the default permissions for these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows Server 2003."
  impact: "If you remove the Access this computer from the network user right on Domain Controllers for all users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network resources. If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to connect to those servers through the network. Successful negotiation of IPsec connections requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore if using IPsec, it is recommended that it be assigned to the Authenticated Users group. If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS), you may need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. It is important to verify that authorized users are assigned this user right for the computers they need to access the network."

  description: "This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred. The recommended state for this setting is: *S-1-5-32-544 and *S-1-5-19 (Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE). Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers."
  rationale: "Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: • All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner. • All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. • All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. • The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate."
  impact: "There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not belong to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source."

  description: "This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista, existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links, the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system. Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic links. The recommended state for this setting is: *S-1-5-32-544 (Administrators) and (when the Hyper-V feature is installed) *S-1-5-83-0 (NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\\Virtual Machines)."

It is highly recommended that you do not assign any user accounts this right. The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the user's privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or connect to a remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change is immediately recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until the next time the user logs on or connects.

  rationale: "Accounts that can log on as a service could be used to configure and start new unauthorized services, such as a keylogger or other malicious software. The benefit of the specified countermeasure is somewhat reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges can install and configure services, and an attacker who has already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the System account."

  description: "This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Remote Desktop clients.

  rationale: "Any account with the right to log on through Remote Desktop Services could be used to log on to the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges."
  impact: "If you assign the Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services user right to other groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment.

  description: "The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user (or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started. Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist: • The access token that is being impersonated is for this user. • The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials to create the access token. • The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

  description: "This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on computers that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also determines which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to the Back up files and directories user right. The recommended state for this setting is: *S-1-5-32-544 (Administrators). Note: This user right is considered a \"sensitive privilege\" for the purposes of auditing."
  rationale: "An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges, compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer. Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data."
  impact: "If you remove the Restore files and directories user right from the Backup Operators group and other accounts you could make it impossible for users who have been delegated specific tasks to perform those tasks.

  description: "This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received. Defer Updates This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available to your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre-release channels and up to 365 days for the Semi-Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi-Annual Channel, a version for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the device reaches end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the version specified will take precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see the Windows Release Information page for OS version information. Pause Updates To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled time, you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35 days from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be offered). Note: If the \"Allow Diagnostic Data\" (formerly \"Allow Telemetry\") policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect. Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured or configure the setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links: • Demystifying “Dual Scan” – WSUS Product Team Blog • Improving Dual Scan on 1607 – WSUS Product Team Blog Note #3: Prior to Windows 10 R1703, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS.
